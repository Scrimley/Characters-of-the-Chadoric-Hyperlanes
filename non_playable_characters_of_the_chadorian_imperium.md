# Non Playable Characters of the Chadorian Imperium 

## Chadorian Imperium 

### Dragoons 

The typical Dragoon is a dangerous foe and not to be underestimated. Although lacking the flexibility to perform most duties, the Dragoon fresh out of drop camp excels at carrying out a frontal assault. While Dragoon casualties may be high, Dragoons&#039; opponents usually value their lives more than victory and break in the face of the Dragoons&#039; sustained attack.

#### Dragoon Recruit 

A Dragoon Recruit are raw or inexperienced soldiers in the early stages of drop camp and may have the skills and equipment required to be considered a Dragoon but will lack the experience required to truly ensure that they correctly perform their role. Dragoon Recruit’s are used when a show of numbers is required and not necessarily experience and as such typically perform the lighter roles that dragoon’s perform for the Imperium, for example: they guard cargo, non security vital doorways and take part in parades.

#### Dragoon 

#### Veteran Dragoon 

A Veteran Dragoon is a survivor of several deployments or even Battles and has gained sufficient experience to be able to be considered a veteran. Their vast experience allows them to learn from the lesser experienced Dragoons to ensure a higher survivability rates among their ranks, through the use of advanced tactics and stronger skills.

#### Elite Dragoon 

An Elite Dragoon are typically grouped together by a Grand Admiral for a specific operation drawn from multiple Dragoon legions.

### Dragoon Officers 

The company-grade Dragoon officer below would be found commanding a company or special detachment.

#### Dragoon Officer 

#### Battalion Commander 

The next level of Dragoon Officer is the deadly, experienced Battalion Commander. Hardened by years of fighting, this veteran soldier is primed to carry out any mission the Leader orders…or lead his men to the death in the attempt.

#### Legion Commander 

At the top of the Dragoon chain-of-command is the Legion Commander. This individual is rarely encountered in the field; anyone unfortunate enough to be in the path of a Legion Commander is unlikely to survive the experience.

### Fleet Officer 

#### Low-Level Fleet Officer 

The lowest-level fleet officer has just graduated from the academy, and at best has command of a patrol ship or escort vessel. They have not distinguished themselves, but may well have a more powerful officer as a patron, gently nurturing their career and watching to see if they deserves a greater command.

#### Mid-Level Fleet Officer 

The mid-level fleet officer has proven themself in combat. They probably commands a mid-sized warship, although they probably not trusted with a Battle cruiser yet. He may be in command of a small fleet of escort or support vessels. They have a loyal following of members of crew who have moved with them from commision to commision, and has caught the notice of their superiors. They have started to begin dabbling in military politics, they it be voluntarily or involuntarily.

Some higher ranked commanders encourage them, while others see them as a threat to their own authority.

#### High-Level Fleet Officer 

The highest-level fleet officer is in command of at least a major starship and may have a dozen ships under his control. Enemies and allies may recognize their name, and they have engaged in dozens of major space conflicts. Thousands of crew members are more loyal to them than their navy, and would rebel with them if they asked it. More than simply a captain, they have become a political force able to swing the fate of whole star systems.

### Serpent Rider 

Serpent Rider’s are Chadorian Pilots who have gained some experience as a pilot in the Imperium. Are recruited to join the Serpent Rider corps.

#### Novice Serpent Rider 

The Novice Serpent Rider is an accomplished pilot who has not yet mastered the art of war.

#### Veteran Serpent Rider 

The Veteran Serpent Rider is truly a rare breed: the survivor of many battles who has honed their skill. The type of fighter this ace prefers to fly functions like an extension of their being.

### Space Dragon 

Space Dragon’s are used to conduct hostile boarding actions during space battles. Despite their heavy armor and firepower, Space Dragons often take enormous casualties and are only used in extreme situations.

### Wyrm 

While Dragoon units have always carried the distinction of keeping themselves free of logistical and support units, even legions need a branch dedicated to reconnaissance and patrol. Wyrm typically ride speeder bikes to fulfill their mission objectives.

## Scum and Villainy 

### Hookec Pirate
